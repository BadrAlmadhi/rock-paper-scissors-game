# rock-paper-scissors-using-js-only

## Description  

In a personal project, I developed a Rock, Paper, Scissors game using JavaScript exclusively. This endeavor proved to be both enjoyable and educational, deepening my understanding of JavaScript's core concepts such as variables, arrays, conditional statements (if-else), and functions. While not a mandatory assignment, I undertook this project voluntarily to reinforce my knowledge gained from a coding boot camp.

Through this experience, I not only honed my programming skills but also gained practical insights into the application of key JavaScript methods, including window.prompt, window.alert, and window.confirm. Understanding the nuances between these methods enabled me to create an engaging user interface for the game.

This project served as a valuable learning opportunity, allowing me to bridge theoretical knowledge with practical implementation. It underscored the importance of these foundational concepts and enhanced my problem-solving abilities. Overall, this endeavor has significantly contributed to my growth as a programmer.
